# Immune Cell Segmentation & Shape Analysis

<h3 align="center">
Immune Cell Segmentation & Shape Analysis is an open-source Snakemake workflow that allows analysis of cell shapes after segmentation using user defined pytorch models.
</h3>

### Installation 

1. Install miniconda following the [installation instructions](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Start the Anaconda Prompt.
3. Navigate to the analysis folder `cd path/to/folder`.
4. Create the python environment and install the required packages by calling:
   1.  ```conda env create -f environment_gpu.yml``` for the prefered GPU version 
   2.   ```conda env create -f environment.yml``` for CPU version[^1].

[^1]: Using the CPU will result in a considerable slowdown of the machine learning segmentation step.

## Executing the Analysis
1. Merge images of different markers from the same image section into one TIFF file, formated as CYX with named channels as C.
1. Insert the merged images into the input folder.
2. Adjust parameters in the config/config.yml file.
   1. Declare cell marker channel names under "target" as a list.
   2. Declare the DAPI channel name under "registration".
   3. Under "ml_segmentation" declare an input with the same name as in target for each target marker and define the model_name, config, checkpoint and a cutoff_value. (model_name "default" will result in using a pretrained model)
3. Open a Terminal application and navigate to the folder
4. Activate the python environment with `conda activate immune_gpu` (or immune for CPU)
5. Type `snakemake -c all --snakefile ./workflow/Snakefile`.
